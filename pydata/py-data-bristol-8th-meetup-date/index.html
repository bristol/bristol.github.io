Given the ageing population and the scarcity of health service resources, doctors often need to make these decisions without consulting a second opinion. Bayesian deep learning can be this precious second opinion in such decision-making processes by favouring a decision, but also stating how certain the network is about this decision. We discuss three different methods (Bayes by Backprop, Dropout, Flipout) how Bayesian deep learning can be implemented, validate their performances on different medical image data sets, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p> <p>‚ö°Ô∏è LIGHTNING TALKS<br/>=====================</p> <p>No lightning talks this time.
