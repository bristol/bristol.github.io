He is a Check Team Leader in Infrastructure and also holds the OSCP qualification but mostly just loves the challenge of the technical aspects of security (Not only the breaking things but how to fix them too!).<br/>When not working you will often find Rob playing CTFs, building labs (to break them) or sat on the beach waiting for enough wind to kitesurf.</p> <p>Presentation 2: Exploiting unknown browsers and objects</p> <p>Abstract: Browsers are embedded everywhere, from popular applications like Steam and Spotify to headless crawlers, IoT devices and games consoles. They execute JavaScript but you don't have a dev console and some don't even allow you to interact with them. Many add custom JavaScript objects and functions but how can you discover all this hidden treasure without any dev tools? My talk introduces a new tool for your arsenal that allows you to inspect and exploit these unknown entities. The Hackability inspector is the missing offensive dev toolkit for security researchers.</p> <p>Bio: Gareth works as a researcher at PortSwigger and loves breaking sandboxes and anything to do with JavaScript. He has developed various free online tools such as Hackvertor and Shazzer. He also created MentalJS a free JavaScript sandbox that provides a safe DOM environment for sandboxed code.</p> </p></div></div>
