So join our Idea Jam and lend your mind to the question of:<br/>How can we build an even more inclusive and vibrant health tech community for Bristol?<br/>* How is the community working for you?<br/>* Where are the gaps/opportunities for topics/communities/sectors etc.<br/>* How can we shake things up with some new ideas?</p> <p>To make your community relevant and inclusive we need a heap of different ideas from people with a range of work and cultural backgrounds. And in true OHT style we want to have fun while we’re thinking … so we'll be putting on free food &amp; drink, and leaving plenty of time to chat and get to know each other better.</p> <p>------</p> <p>ACCESSIBILITY</p> <p>We’ve been awarded a Fairer Tech grant from doteveryone to make our events more accessible (woop woop!). If for any reason there are barriers to engaging in the community we invite anyone to apply for up to £30 (but ask for more if you need, worth a try) per person per event to cover personal costs to improve this. The money can cover just about anything, including but not limited to child/other care, taxis if you’re not able-bodied, trains if you live out in the countryside, a live captioner, recording of the event or loss of earnings if you have a side job along your studies. If you feel it’s a barrier, we agree too. <a href="https://www.onehealthtech.com/accessibiltity-fund" class="linkified">https://www.onehealthtech.com/accessibiltity-fund</a></p> </p></div></div>
