It's a great opportunity to network with folk either interested in, or who work with SQL, and learn something new from our great speakers. We also have free pizza and drinks from our kind sponsors Just Eat. Afterwards some of us head to a local pub for a bit more relaxing and chatting. Feel free to come along.</p> <p>Look out for organisers with an orange lanyard if you need any info (or just for a chat!).
