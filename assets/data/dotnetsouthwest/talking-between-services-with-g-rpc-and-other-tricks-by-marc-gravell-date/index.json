A wide range of service layers exist for this, but .NET Core 3 adds first-class support for gRPC, Google’s preferred offering.</p> <p>In this session, Marc Gravell from Stack Overflow looks at how you can integrate gRPC between your applications – or to external gRPC resources – with efficiency and high performance, including new options for publishing and consuming gRPC services.</p> <p>About Marc</p> <p>Marc has been a remote developer for Stack Overflow since 2010 (and is somehow also still in the top 10 on the “users” board), usually working on the back-end plumbing for tools like SQL Server or Redis, with a keen eye on high performance and scalability with a C# bias. He is the author/co-author of multiple popular .NET libraries such as “StackExchange.Redis”, “Dapper” and “Protobuf-net” and an active member of the .NET open source community.</p> "}},"context":{}}
