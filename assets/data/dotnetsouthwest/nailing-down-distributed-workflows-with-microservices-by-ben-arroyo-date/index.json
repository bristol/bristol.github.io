These bring up different challenges such as integration with different systems, long-lived transactions, failure recovery and more.<br/>In this session weâ€™ll learn how to address these issues with a distributed, event-driven architecture based on microservices that Iâ€™ve been using successfully in the last three years across different projects. We also learn how to implement this architecture with MassTransit and Automatonymous and run it on containers with Kubernetes.</p> <p>The session broken down into three parts. In the first part of the session weâ€™ll brush up some DDD patterns and microservices patterns such as sagas, orchestration and different communication patterns.<br/>On the second part weâ€™ll put those patterns in practice by building up the sample architecture for an imaginary business, which requires integration with external systems with different communication protocols and built with different technologies (Python, Node, â€¦).<br/>On the final part weâ€™ll see how to implement the architecture.</p> "}},"context":{}}
