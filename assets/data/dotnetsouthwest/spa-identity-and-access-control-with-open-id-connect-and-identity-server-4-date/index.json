Nowadays we have to accommodate a variety of client applications, hosted on any device, anywhere in the world and this means we must take a closer look at how we handle authentication and authorization when dealing with our protected resources.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll take a look at how Single Page Applications, running on a user’s browser, can use OpenID Connect for authentication and OAuth to gain access to data from an API. This will include the limitations of working with the unique security profile of a client side web application, and the measures we must take to secure our data. Once we have covered the basic theory behind identity and access control, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, we will implement IdentityServer 4 as our OpenID Connect Provider and use it to authenticate users for an Angular 4 SPA and authorize access to a ASP.NET Core API.</p> <p><b>About Scott Brady</b></p> <p>Scott Brady is the Identity &amp; Access Control Lead at Rock Solid Knowledge, a Pluralsight Author, and Speaker.
