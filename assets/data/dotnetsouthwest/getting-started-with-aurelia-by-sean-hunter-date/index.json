With the sheer volume of new tools to learn it can be difficult to decide what is worthwhile spending time on, what is a short lived fad, and how the new tools fit into our existing toolset.</p> <p>Over the past year we’ve seen a trend toward creating single page web applications as a collection of modular components. AngularJS was the first framework to really formalise this concept, with ReactJS taking the concept further to really make it a first class citizen. Aurelia provides a convenient set of conventions and tools, making it straight forward to build web applications in this way, while also providing a standard set of plugins for things like routing and validation that save us a lot of time when creating large scale applications.</p> <p>In this session, we’ll take a deep dive into what Aurelia is, where it fits into the SPA framework landscape, and why it might be a useful tool to add to your web development tool-belt.</p> <p>The session will cover the following topics:</p> <p>•  Getting started<br/>• Views and View Models<br/>• Configuration and Routing<br/>• Templates and Binding<br/>• Connecting to a backend data store or web service</p> <p><b>About Sean:<br/></b>I’m a software developer with a passion for learning and sharing what I know with the community. I’ve recently moved to the sunny Worcester after 6 years of web development in Melbourne Australia and am working as a software developer with PCA Predict on the Microsoft stack, specialising in all things JavaScript.</p> <p><b>Meeting Sponsors: Just Eat</b></p> <p><b>Don't forget to follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dotnetsouthwest\">@dotnetsouthwest</a> for news and updates.<br/></b></p> "}},"context":{}}
