I'll describe how to build OS images using Yocto/OpenEmbedded, and the value that approach provides for production projects.</p> <p>// ABOUT PHIL</p> <p>Phil Wise is a freelance embedded Linux consultant. He was previously a Lead Senior Engineer at HERE Technologies. His team contributed Software Over The Air update functionality to the AGL Automotive Grade Linux project and maintains the 'meta-updater' Yocto layer for software updates.</p> <p>He has presented at Embedded Linux Conference (ELC), the OpenIoT conference and at the AGL All Members Meeting.</p> <p>// DAVE COOPER - (FRONT END) MOCKING MADE EASY</p> <p>This talk dives into the little-discussed-about fact that injecting mock data into web applications for local development and integration testing isn't a well-solved problem. I then shamelessly spruik a library I wrote to solve this problem in a much lighter and intuitive way.</p> <p>// ABOUT DAVE</p> <p>I'm Dave - a frontend developer at OVO Energy who likes to write the codes and break things all the time.</p> "}},"context":{}}
