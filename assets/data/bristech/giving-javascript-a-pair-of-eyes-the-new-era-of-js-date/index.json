In the second talk, Jack Franklin (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FJack_Franklin%3Frefsrc%3Demail&amp;sig=2724f225e981e5fe5ff64221a0a7fd669ac14f95&amp;uid=1600909274&amp;iid=37c35333-2983-4329-96fd-2c5607a7159d&amp;nid=6+279&amp;t=1\">@Jack_Franklin</a>) is going to wax lyrical about some of the enterprise javascript frameworks out there including GruntJS and EmberJS in his talk entitled \"The New Era of JS\". It will certainly prove to be an interesting evening!</p> <p>As ever, we will have beer (on tap) and food; this month we are foregoing the pizza and opting for some veggie tacos from a local Bristol vendor \"El Greengo's Tacos\" (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElgreengoSimon\">@ElgreengoSimon</a>) so Mexican hats are compulsory ;)</p> "}},"context":{}}
