So I made a change, I open-sourced it and released it, hopefully for the better at least it seems that way so far. I decided to do the same with everything else I’ve ever built (or at least the bits I have the code for) and everything that has come since. I want to talk about this change, why I made it and the good &amp; bad that have followed.</p> <p>Adam Butler</p> <p>Adam Butler is a Full-stack Web Developer at Simpleweb, in his spare time he runs BristolJS, enjoys hacking with hardware, building robots and skydiving.</p> "}},"context":{}}
