In this talk, we’ll see what makes Clojure a great language for coding creative projects such as visualisations, games, synthesisers and web sites.</p> <p>We’ll start with a short explanation of Clojure’s syntax before diving into some live coding. Absolute beginners and seasoned experts are all welcome!</p> <p>Matt Thompson is an EngD researcher working with Sysemia Ltd in Bristol to develop the next generation of interactive, procedurally generated stories for computer games.
