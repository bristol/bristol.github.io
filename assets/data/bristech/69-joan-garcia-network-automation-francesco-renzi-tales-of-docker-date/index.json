Why today's networks struggle to adapt to change</p> <p>Network Infrastructure - components, devices and connectivity are increasingly the bottle-neck that is preventing digital transformation. Too many business-critical activities require agility from the network infrastructure to the extent network infrastructure is now critical business infrastructure. As services increase in number, as we layer technologies on top of each other, as we increase network complexity and the number of users our networks become a cause of frustration. Because of this the network operations organisations are under increasing pressure.</p> <p>How do you solve this problem? Using network automation, control and analytics \"intent-based networking\" is a fundamentally different approach. In intent-based networks the focus is the delivery of the end-to-end service, which allows the service to dictate the network and not the other way around. Find out how Zeetta Networks is working with leading organisations in the South-West to deliver intelligent network automation.</p> <p># About Joan</p> <p>Joan Garcia Espín is experienced in telecommunications and software engineering with a passion for productisation of novel networking technologies.</p> <p>He has worked in R&amp;D and innovation for over 17 years in top international projects on networks of the future.<br/>Joan has also worked for the i2CAT Research Centre and Scytl in Barcelona and the Bristol Is Open smart city initiative before joining Zeetta.</p> <p>Joan has an MSc in Telematics Engineering and a Master in Business Innovation and collaborates with the University of Bristol to mentor students as part of their entrepreneurship program.</p> <p># Francesco Renzi - Explaining Docker through storytelling</p> <p>Let’s get away from all the fancy words and see how we can explain what Docker is and how it works to anyone by using a little bit of storytelling and a couple metaphors. Too often in tech we hide behind buzzwords that really don’t help in including everyone in a conversation, but not today: today we explain Docker using food trucks and knives, giving everyone the tools to easily understand or to go and explain their colleagues and friends what Docker is.</p> <p># About Francesco</p> <p>I’m a former professional basketball player, who graduated as a designer and then became a software engineer. I’m really passionate about explaining tech things to non tech people, something I developed thanks to my grandma who everyday asks me how work was.</p> "}},"context":{}}
