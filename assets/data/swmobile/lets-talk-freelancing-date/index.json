The Tao of one-man-band app development'</b></p> <p>I came to the previous meet-up on this topic and it was that which inspired me to finally take my work life into my own hands and become a freelancer. Almost 18 months on, it's been quite a journey but I’m so pleased that I did it and I’m looking forward to sharing the information I’ve picked up along the way. I’ll be talking about my experience, mistakes, some do’s, don’ts and general thoughts about all things freelance.</p> <p><b>Dave Jones - 'Tales (and tips) from the contracting coalface'</b></p> <p>Group regular and successful Android contractor Dave Jones will share his experiences of running his own business from the contractor and limited company director perspective.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>James Barlow - \"Every Freelancer is a Project Manager, but some of them don't know it yet\" </b></p> <p>James Barlow from Cloudshout LLP talks about growing your practice as a freelancer and doing more - quantity and quality - by collaborating with your peers, and hiring other freelancers.</p> "}},"context":{}}
