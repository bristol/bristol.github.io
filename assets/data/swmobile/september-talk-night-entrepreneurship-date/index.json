Most of us have probably dreamt of starting up our own company and being the next Gates/Zuckerberg/Jobs/etc., but what is it really like?</p> <p>We'll hear from two companies that have started from scratch and are now making a success of it with an App. What inspired them? What has it been like? What advice do they have for others? We're also hoping to have a couple of introductions from local Bristol incubators and so that you can talk to them and learn more about what support is on offer for local start ups. This will be fun and interesting whether you are interested in stating a company or not. </p> <p><b><i>Speakers: </i></b></p> <p>1) Wriggle</p> <p><i>Wriggle are a Bristol-Born Mobile App, Website and Guide with a simple goal: to encourage people to discover more of their city through great independent food &amp; drink, and to help them save a few pounds in the process.
