How long will we have to spend fixing our apps to be Swift 3 compatible?</p> <p>🤖 Google could bring us some interesting new platforms: Android VR, Project Tango, and Google Chirp (a potential Alexa competitor)</p> <p>🍭 Will Android N get a sweet new name?</p> <p>⌚️ Only time will tell what improvements we'll see to Android Wear and Apple Watch</p> <p>✈️ If you're not hopping on a plane to California this month, then hop on a bus to SWMobile instead!</p> <p>🙋🏻 If you're interested in speaking at this event, please get in touch! You can email [masked], or send us a message through Meetup.com. We already have one speaker for \"What's new in iOS\", but we're definitely in need of somebody to cover Android. Or perhaps you'd like to do a short 5 or 10 minute talk on one specific feature? Let us know!</p> "}},"context":{}}
