We’re kicking this year off with a social/networking night on Tuesday 23rd Jan. We’ve decided to go for a social rather than talk night mainly as the main organisers are either recovering from illness, starting new job or moving house. So we figured let's ease in to 2018 gently and get together for a chat about the kinds of speakers,talks and events you want to see in 2018. Please come with suggestions! • What to bring<br/>Yourself (and guest if you like)</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>As usual we’ll cover a drink or two but we recommend grabbing a bite to eat before hand.</p> "}},"context":{}}
