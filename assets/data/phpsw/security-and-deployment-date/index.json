Some features aren’t going to make the cut, but the boss really wants to make sure these critical bugs are fixed. You can’t wait for the release cycle to be over so you can relax.</p> <p>But what if I told you it didn’t have to be that way? What if I could show you how to create a world where there is no release cycle? A world where weekend deployments are a rarity, not the norm?! In this talk we will cover the steps we took to achieve the coding utopia of releasing a feature as soon as it’s ready - many times per day. You’ll find out that by implementing a continuous deployment flow, you can empower your developers to take ownership and become more productive.</p> <p>- <b>Security in the face of adversity</b> <br/>   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lowlysysadm1n\">Dave Tibbs</a>, Systems Administrator at <a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com\">Brightpearl</a> US, briefly in the UK!</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brightpearl.com\">Brightpearl</a> have kindly offered to host the evening, providing food, beers and their office as the venue.
