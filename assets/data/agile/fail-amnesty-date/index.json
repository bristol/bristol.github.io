We tried hard to line up a speaker this month, but things did not quite work out. We do have a couple of great speakers in the pipeline for the next few months, and will aim to be better at sharing what's happening in future.</p> <p>But we feel that the Agile Bath &amp; Bristol community believes in transparency and learning, so in that spirit, this month we're holding a Fail Amnesty. Share your mistakes so other people don't make them.</p> <p>What weâ€™ll do: Introductions / Share stories / Q&amp;A, discussion / Wrap up. Whether it relates to teams, tech, projects or organisations, please come along to share a story of failure and the valuable lessons you learned. Send a message to the event organiser before the event if you have a story to share. Or just come along, this is an informal session so there should be opportunity to share on the night.</p> "}},"context":{}}
