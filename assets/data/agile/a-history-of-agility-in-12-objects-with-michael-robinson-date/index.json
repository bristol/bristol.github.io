Our goal is to discover lessons from past times that can help us meet our volatile future.</p> <p>For the business in which we work, we’ll discuss objects from the ancient Greeks, the CIA and others that might offer more insight into an ‘Agile’ way forward than simply trying to reverse-engineer software practices for wider application.</p> <p>For ourselves, we’ll discuss the human need for Agility, some personal challenges in achieving it, and the beauty of helping others have it.</p> <p>And because it’s our own time, we’ll have some fun along the way - please come prepared for interaction and collaboration :-)</p> <p>About our speaker:<br/>Mike Robinson is an independent agile consultant, who’s been helping people, managers and teams in many industries, since first learning of “Agile\" in 1994.</p> <p>Huge thanks to Matthew Dodwell and BJSS for helping to make the event happen.</p> "}},"context":{}}
