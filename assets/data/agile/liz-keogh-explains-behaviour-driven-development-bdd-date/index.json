It uses examples to illustrate the intended behavior of systems before they're implemented, so that the team can discover more examples and develop a shared understanding of the requirements. In this talk Liz will show why conversations are the most important aspect of BDD, how examples can help you discover things early, and why discovery is an inevitable part of software development.</p> <p><b>Who is Liz Keogh?</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/2/8/event_123798472.jpegLiz\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/2/8/event_123798472.jpegLiz</a> is an experienced Lean and Agile coach, trainer, blogger and well-known international speaker.
