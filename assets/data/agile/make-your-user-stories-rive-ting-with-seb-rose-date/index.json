For over a decade User Stories have been the rock steady investment of agile adoption – and they’ve come a long way since XP called them “a placeholder for a conversation”. It’s time to re-evaluate what user stories are trying to achieve, what they’re good for, and why so many of them suck.</p> <p>In this session we’ll explore what a good user story should look like and discover why so many of them fail to live up to our expectations. We’ll look under the covers of the INVEST acronym, created by Mike Cohn to help people write better user stories and look at why, in many cases, it doesn’t seem to have helped.</p> <p>It’s time to stop investing in the boring, formulaic user stories that litter your boards, choke your JIRA and stifle your meetings. Today we’re going to see how to make user stories RIVETing again.</p> <p>About our speaker:</p> <p>Seb has been involved in the full development lifecycle with experience that ranges from Architecture to Support, from BASIC to Ruby. He’s a partner in Cucumber Limited, who help teams adopt and refine their agile practices, with a particular focus on collaboration and automated testing.</p> <p>Regular speaker at conferences and occasional contributor to software journals. Co-author of “BDD Books 1: Discovery” (LeanPub), lead author of “The Cucumber for Java Book” (Pragmatic Programmers), and contributing author to “97 Things Every Programmer Should Know” (O’Reilly).</p> <p>He blogs at cucumber.io and tweets as @sebrose.</p> "}},"context":{}}
