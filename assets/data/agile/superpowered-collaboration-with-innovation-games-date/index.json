How do you create a collaborative environment where we feel safe to share? How do we explore things that need to be said in a way that generates positive results?</p> <p>Collaboration and Innovation are tough. But when done right, when we are stretched, when we have fun, we can achieve some amazing results. We can turn that dreaded meeting into a something playful. </p> <p>Innovation Games help you get into the sweet spot of collaboration.</p> <p>In this session, JP and Jose will introduce you to one of the many Collaboration Frameworks that are part of Innovation Games and allow groups of people to share their negative experiences in project management in a fun, colourful, collaborative and constructive way.</p> <p>Innovation Games are a set of collaboration frameworks created by Luke Hohmann of Conteneo. They are excellent tools to have in your facilitation toolbox. You can use them for many project activities and to create project artefacts too. During this highly interactive session, we'll take a very high level overview of the games and then play one of them to give you a sense of what is possible. We'll discuss our experiences of using the games in an Agile environment, and cover some of the other common uses.</p> <p><b>Jean-Paul Bayley</b></p> <p>Jean-Paul Bayley is the Lead Consultant of Bay Spark Ltd., a firm specialising in business agility and organisational development.
