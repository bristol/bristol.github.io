Many claim to enhance D3 without removing its awesome power, yet all that I have found result in the usual API bloat. Based on first hand experience, I’ll talk you through the logical leaps and the painful doubling-backs of building on D3.</i></p> <p><b>GSAP - Paul Thomas</b></p> <p><i>I'll be looking at some of the basics of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) and why you may want to use it over other libraries and CSS. We'll briefly visit JS vs CSS performance</i>. We'll take a look at where I've used it in real projects and some of the more unlikely places you might be able to use it. If anyone has any particular queries or something they would like to see, then please let me know in advance so I can try and address them.</p> "}},"context":{}}
