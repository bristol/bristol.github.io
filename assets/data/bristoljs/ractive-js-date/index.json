It uses two-way data-binding to reduce the amount of code needed to do complex UI interactions. Like Facebook's React library it uses a virtual DOM to track changes and only updates the necessary DOM elements; this makes it much more efficient for operations that hit the DOM regularly as it avoids unnecessary repaints.</p> "}},"context":{}}
