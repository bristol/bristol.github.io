But as software is built faster, becomes more complex and interconnected, and handles more critical functions and data, it’s clear modern software has outstripped our ability to secure it. DevOps has produced stunning results for software speed and quality, but do they translate for security? In this talk, Jeff will present the “Three Ways of Security” – an interpretation of the DevOps classic, “The Phoenix Project” for security. You’ll learn how to get your security work flowing, how to create continuous security feedback, and how to create a culture of security experimentation and learning. Bring your hard questions – Jeff likes a “town hall” style meeting!</p> <p><b>Bio</b>:  Jeff Williams is the co-founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as the Chair of the OWASP Board for 8 years and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI), OWASP Application Security Verification Standard(ASVS), XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, WebGoat and many other widely adopted free and open projects.
