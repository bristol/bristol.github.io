Thanks to Modern C++ and a wide selection of new libraries developed for it, everyday programmers can finally take advantage of the wide world of compile-time programming.</p> <p>To demonstrate what fun new tools C++17 brings to the table, we’ll see how to pragmatically compose a switch/case, a faster and simpler tuple, compile-time string manipulation, the simplest heterogeneous container ever, and much more!</p> <p>If time permits, we’ll see what the future may look like for a C++ programmer, with ongoing proposals and language development – including metaclasses, static reflection and concepts.</p> <p>Biography:</p> <p>Chris is a recently graduated software engineer for a company called SEA.</p> <p>A glutton for punishment, he jumped into C++ early in his programming endeavor. Lunch breaks, after school and holidays, became opportunities to reinvent the wheel and learn more about the language.</p> <p>With so many nooks and crannies, finding new and interesting ways to use (and abuse) C++ has become a hobby that he loves to share (whether those unfortunate enough to inquire like it or not).</p> "}},"context":{}}
