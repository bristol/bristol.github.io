Paxport/Multicom, based in UK and Sweden, have recently adopted a recommendation system for holiday accommodation bookings. Machine learning techniques such as Collaborative Filtering have been applied using Python (3.5.1), with Jupyter (4.0.6) as the main framework. </p> <p>Data scale and sparsity present significant challenges in the case study, and so the effectiveness of various techniques are described as well as the performance of Python-based libraries such as Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas), and Scikit-learn (built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib). </p> <p>We will look at how a problem mainly based in analysis and data modeling can be alleviated by the notebook environment provided by Jupyter is also provided.</p> <p>Bio - After graduating in software engineering Pedro’s interest in artificial intelligence led him to work in the video game industry for a year. That same interest has him now taking part of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Paxport(Multicom) and University of West of England working on a Machine Learning related problem. </p> "}},"context":{}}
