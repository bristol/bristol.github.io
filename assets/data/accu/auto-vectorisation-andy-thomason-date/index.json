GPUs do this when they compile kernals but to get the right preconditions for autovectorisation in C++, we have to jump through a few hoops.</p> <p>In particular we will talk about alias analysis, loop pragmas, intrinsics idioms, AVX512, vectorisable maths functions and data access patterns.</p> "}},"context":{}}
