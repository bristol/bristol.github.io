How can privacy advocates carry their message forward when the majority of online users do not understand Facebook’s business model, what a VPN is or get discouraged at simply hearing the word “encryption”? Getting to understand tech lingo requires patience, dedication, realization of what lack of knowledge can lead to. This means effort. Effort that the majority of nontechie users are not willing to make.</p> <p>Privacy concerns are on the rise, that is true. Yet this increase is due to online users that already have some sort of knowledge of the topic. They are the ones that choose to protect themselves online. What about the rest? What about the ignorants or the uneducated? I refuse to say “They deserve it!” Among  because they’re the ones shaping our relationship with tech advancement.</p> <p>So, how do we communicate complex issues of BigData to those embracing living in ignorance, in the unknown or those embracing a big “I got nothing to hide” argument?</p> <p>I will start with a short 15 mins presentation about what I’ve come up with so far and then open up the discussions. Let’s talk about communication barriers. Let’s talk about making the obvious, obvious... in a digestible manner.\"</p> "}},"context":{}}
