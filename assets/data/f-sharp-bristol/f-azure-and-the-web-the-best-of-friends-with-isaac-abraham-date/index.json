F# is a great fit not only for web programming but also for the Cloud. In this fast paced session, we’ll cover how we can harness the power of HTTP, F# and cloud services to develop compelling applications that are more than the sum of their parts. We’ll discover how we can quickly and easily write stand-alone, data-driven applications in F#, progressively adding more features through simple composition. We'll then quickly and easily hook them up to .NET web frameworks. We’ll also demonstrate how to easily expose data from F# as standard JSON for consumption by a web client single page application. We’ll then move on to how cloud services provide a fantastic hosting platform for F# web applications and demonstrate some of the awesome features that Microsoft Azure provides us from deployment through to hosting, scalability and resiliency. We’ll also look at how we can seamlessly plug in diagnostics, metrics and analytics within an application and view them through a dashboard integrated directly into the Azure portal.</p> <p>About Isaac:</p> <p>Isaac Abraham is an F# MVP and a .NET developer since .NET 1.0 with an interest in cloud computing and distributed data problems.
