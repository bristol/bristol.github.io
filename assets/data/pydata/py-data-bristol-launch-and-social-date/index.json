We would especially like to meet anyone interested in contributing a talk (or a five-minute lightning talk) in the coming months. Everyone welcome regardless of experience, and it will hopefully be a good opportunity to do some networking and have a general chat over a couple of drinks.</p> <p>We currently plan to hold PyData Bristol every other month, on the third Thursday of each month, as follows:<br/>• Thu 15th Feb 2018 – Launch &amp; Social<br/>• Thu 15th Mar 2018 – Speakers TBC<br/>• Thu 17th May 2018 - Speakers TBC<br/>• Thu 19th July 2018 - Speakers TBC<br/>• ...etc...</p> "}},"context":{}}
