Thanks to Workshop Wednesdays for hosting (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Tech-Hub-Bristol/events/261479024/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Tech-Hub-Bristol/events/261479024/</a>).</p> <p>This is the second study group meeting and all are welcome to attend - you do not need to have attended the first meeting. We will be using a variety of material so as to accommodate a range of experience. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like more information.</p> <p>All levels and genders are welcome, though the focus is likely to be on those who are less (or no) experienced in python. We would warmly welcome those who have a few python skills already and would be willing to support the groups â€“ it will be a fun way of helping your own development, as well as being a great addition to your CV!</p> "}},"context":{}}
