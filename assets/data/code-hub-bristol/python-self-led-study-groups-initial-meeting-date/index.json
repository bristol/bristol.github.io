The aim is to bring together people who want to learn or improve their python skills, provide suggestions on learning materials/courses, and share experiences on what makes effective self-led groups. At the end of the evening we’d hope that there would be one or more groups who have agreed to study together and have, at least, planned the next step.</p> <p>All levels and genders are welcome, though the focus is likely to be on those who are less (or no) experienced in python. We would warmly welcome those who have a few python skills already and would be willing to support the groups – it will be a fun way of helping your own development, as well as being a great addition to your CV!</p> "}},"context":{}}
