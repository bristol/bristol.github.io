Thanks to Workshop Wednesdays for hosting (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Tech-Hub-Bristol/events/261479040/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Tech-Hub-Bristol/events/261479040/</a>).</p> <p>We are resuming this study group after the summer break - there is no need to have attended previous sessions to come and join in. The emphasis is on studying at your own pace and level, alongside other learners. We share learning materials - or you can bring your own. Some attendees like to work through their own problems or projects, whilst others prefer to compare notes &amp; experience with their peers - whatever works (within reason!). This term we may try a few mini-challenges during the evening (but there is no pressure to join in!) Please feel free to contact me if you'd like more information.</p> <p>All levels and genders are welcome, though the focus is likely to be on those who are less (or no) experienced in python. We would warmly welcome those who have a few python skills already and would be willing to support the groups â€“ it will be a fun way of helping your own development, as well as being a great addition to your CV!</p> "}},"context":{}}
