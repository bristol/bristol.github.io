How hard can it be?</p> <p>You've written your application. Maybe this consists of some<br/>micro-services, maybe even some \"serverless\" functions. What you need<br/>now is a way to route external traffic to your app. Just stick an NGINX<br/>in front, right? Enter the API gateway service...</p> <p>We'll talk about the architecture of Oracle APIGW service - which is currently being built by teams in California and Bristol and is a global-scale multi-tenant service. We'll pull back the curtain on the implementation choices we made, discuss some of the trade-offs and describe how we ensure secure and efficient use of our hardware.</p> <p>Kristen Jacobs is a principal software engineer in Oracleâ€™s cloud<br/>infrastructure group. He spent the first 15 years of his career working in<br/>microprocessor development, but for the past 5 (ish) years has switched from the very small to the very large and is now working on cloud infrastructure.</p> <p>More specifically, right now focused on the design and implementation of the OCI managed API gateway service.</p> <p>19:05 - 19:35 Dan Jones (Customer Reliability Engineer, Jetstack) will speak on 'The Cloud Native Holy Trinity'</p> <p>This talk explores the cloud native options for quickly building applications in Google Cloud, including Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, GKE and Firebase.</p> "}},"context":{}}
