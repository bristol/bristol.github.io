With over 9,000 answers to his name on Stack Overflow, he just might know something about what makes a good, answerable question.</p> <p>When not improving Stack Overflow, he can be found enjoying anime &amp; manga, reading sci-fi books and spending time with his family.</p> <p>--- TALK 2 ---</p> <p>Topic: Alex West - .NET for Indie Devs</p> <p>Description: When we talk about Dot NET most think it's for Enterprise (with capital E), big banks with loads of cash, companies with more Microsoft licenses you can shake a stick at. MS is now making a concerted effort to disrupt this image and is making .NET available for all, not only those who can afford the complicated licensing agreements.
