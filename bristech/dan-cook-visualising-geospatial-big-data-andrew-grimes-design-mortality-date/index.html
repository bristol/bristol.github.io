Although he did have a short break last year to have fun building a web app! When he's not coding, he can either be found in the pub or crawling very slowly up a hill on a bicycle.</p> <p>// Andrew Grimes - Design mortality - negotiating a longer life for digital ideas</p> <p>It isn’t really that difficult to come up with a design idea or even to bring it to life. The difficult part is launching that life into the world and then sustaining it. Design ideas die in translation, or because of changes (in the context of use, in technologies or the competitive landscape) and for a million other reasons. Our work is often obsolete within years or perhaps months. As implementors, the best we can hope for is to negotiate as long a life as possible for our digital creations. In this talk, we’ll examine where the quality of ‘aliveness’ comes from. We’ll look at ways we can seek it out and how to nurture it. We’ll examine the special role that *negotiation* plays in delivering longer-lasting design ideas, and we’ll finish up with a set of practical negotiation techniques that you’ll be able to apply within your own digital projects.</p> <p>// About Andrew<br/>Andrew Grimes (<a href="http://apgrimes.co.uk/" class="linkified">http://apgrimes.co.uk/</a>) is a Principal Experience Designer at Nationwide, Bristol (<a href="http://www.nationwide.co.uk/" class="linkified">http://www.nationwide.co.uk/</a>).
