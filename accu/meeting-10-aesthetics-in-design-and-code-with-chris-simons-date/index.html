As this was rather fun, Chris studied for his MSc in IT from Bristol Polytechnic in 1989. He became a software engineer, then architect, then methodology and design consultant and trainer, before then taking up a lectureship at the University of the West of England, Bristol in 2002. He was able to bring his software development experience to the emerging research field of artificial intelligence, and in 2011 obtained his PhD in interactive, evolutionary computation for early lifecycle software design. Chris now actively researches in the field of Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE). Chris is a Member of the British Computer Society and a Certified IT Professional.
